# An Adapter to get Power from your Tomtom Rider Mount to your Mobile.

## This is a Remix

The original idea and Model can be found here
[Printables.com: TomTom Rider mount adaptor | Power your phone from a sat-nav bracket](https://www.printables.com/de/model/72591-tomtom-rider-mount-adaptor-power-your-phone-from-a).

The remix can be found [here](https://www.printables.com/de/model/414497-tomtom-rider-mount-adaptor-remix).

## Background

I liked the original idea and make of this adapter - but did not want to have my phone sit on top of the adapter itself. I only use PLA which is not so longliving in the summer sun. Therefore I installed a Quad Lock mount for my mobile next to the Tomtom mount.

The adapter is just connecting to the power supply on the Tomtom mount and passes that through an USB cable.


## Modifications


**First modification:** create new  to perfectly fit with the brass nails shown below.
I wasn't able to find the 2mm brass rod recommended in the original model. My solution: tiny brass nails.

**Second modification:** create a new cable exit that points downward. Also make it look like a funnel to prevent knicks at edge of the opening.
The phone mount is to the right of the Tomtom mount and I wanted the USB cable to connect from below.

**Third modification:** I increased thickness to make more room for cabling / resistors. 
Room is luxury when looking at the original models wiring.

Turned out I could have saved that - my default resistor pack did not offer values that came anywhere close to the ratio that was required for the voltage divider.
So I went without the resistors entirely.

A test with a laboratory power supply showed my phone charging with 1,15 A also without the resistors.

**Fourth modification:** Since the top part no longer holds the phone adapter - that surface demanded some beautification. I created a little logo with some text to fill the empty space.

## Result

It fits nicely on the Tomtom mount and provides energy while navigating:
