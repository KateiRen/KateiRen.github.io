# Going for a second edition

Its the time of the year again. The weather gets warmer and the next trips on the bike are getting closer. The adaptor from last year didn't hold to its expectations. My phone ran out of battery while driving around navigating on the phone.
I wasn't able to get the power out of the charger to keep the deivce juiced up during driving.

Thats why I started tinkering on the adaptor again. Last time I wasn't 100% following the instructions as the required resistors were out of the usual to be found steps in my resistor library. Combining some ordinary resistors in a way to get to the same voltage divider was not possible due to the lack of space in the design. 

This time I was ordering exactle whats needed plus a USB A socket to stay flexible with the cabling.

## This is a Remix

## Result

It fits nicely on the Tomtom mount and provides energy while navigating:
